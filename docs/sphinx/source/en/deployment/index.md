# Deployment

A hands-on playbook for moving a UniLab policy across hardware, simulation
backends, and source frameworks. Each tutorial follows the same shape:

1. **What you start with** — the trained artefact and config.
2. **What changes** — the minimal set of edits in code, YAML, and assets.
3. **How you validate** — concrete commands and checkpoints.
