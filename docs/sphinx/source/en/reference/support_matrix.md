# Support Matrix

This matrix is generated conceptually from registry entries, owner YAMLs, and
tests. The generator implementation is `src/unilab/utils/support_matrix.py`; the
write target for the generated block is currently the Chinese reference page
`docs/sphinx/source/zh_CN/user_guide/E-reference/01-backend-support-matrix.md`.

## Evidence Grades

| Grade | Repository Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| `Registered` | The env/backend pair appears after `registry.ensure_registries()`. |
| `Configured` | A matching owner YAML exists under `conf/ppo/task`, `conf/appo/task`, or `conf/offpolicy/task`. |
| `Tested` | Automated tests cover the entrypoint/task-owner/backend combination through config compose or runtime smoke. |
| `Benchmarked` | A checked-in benchmark manifest exists for the combination. |
| `Recommended` | Explicit recommendation metadata exists in the repo. |

The current generator reports no checked-in benchmark manifest and no separate
recommendation metadata, so rows do not auto-promote to `Benchmarked` or
`Recommended`.
