# Domain Randomization Contract

Domain randomization is an env-owner provider contract plus backend capability
application. User configuration examples live in
{doc}`../../user_guide/domain_randomization/index`.

## Lifecycle Classes

- Init lifecycle: changes model identity or geometry. These changes run during
  env/backend initialization, materialization, or cache construction.
- Reset lifecycle: changes state or parameters within the same model identity.
  Providers dispatch a reset randomization payload through `ResetPlan`.
- Interval lifecycle: applies perturbations between steps, such as push or body
  force plans.

Hot paths must not parse XML/assets or probe backend private methods with
`getattr` or `hasattr`.

## Provider Minimum

A task that uses DR should define:

1. A task-owned domain-randomization config dataclass.
2. A `DomainRandomizationProvider`.
3. Reset behavior returning `ResetPlan` state and randomization payloads.
4. Interval behavior through `IntervalRandomizationPlan` when needed.
5. Env construction that calls `self._init_domain_randomization(...)`.

Shared types live in `src/unilab/dr/types.py`, and manager behavior lives in
`src/unilab/dr/manager.py`.

## Backend Capability Boundary

Backend support is explicit. A reset or interval item only counts as a unified
DR item when three pieces exist together:

1. `ResetRandomizationPayload` or `IntervalRandomizationPlan` has an explicit
   field.
2. The backend declares and implements the capability.
3. The task config/provider samples and dispatches that field.

MuJoCo and Motrix differences stay in backend capability declarations,
backend implementations, and owner YAMLs.

## MuJoCo BatchEnvPool Snapshot

Current MuJoCo reset randomization uses `BatchEnvPool.reset(...,
randomization=...)` with a fixed field whitelist. Indexed reads and writes are
available through `get_field_indexed(...)` and `set_field_indexed(...)`.

The field names documented in the current code path include `body_mass`,
`body_ipos`, `body_iquat`, `body_inertia`, `dof_armature`, `gravity`,
`geom_friction`, `kp`, and `kd`.

## Motor Control Extension

Motor-actuator tasks that do not map policy output directly to backend position
actuators should keep conversion in the env owner layer. Register a pre-step
callback through `SimBackend.set_pre_step_control(...)`; the backend calls it
before physics substeps and refreshes sensors after stepping.

Go2W is the current all-motor actuator example: its env owner combines leg
position targets and wheel torque, while kp/kd randomization stays in the env
owner cache rather than leaking MuJoCo position-actuator mechanics into shared
payloads.
